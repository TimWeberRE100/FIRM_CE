        Initialise a Network instance.

        Parameters:
        -------
        static_instance (boolean): True value indicates 'static' instance, False indicates 'dynamic' instance.
            A static instance is unsafe to modify within a worker process for the unit commitment process.
        nodes (DictType(int64, Node_InstanceType)): Typed dictionary of Node instances keyed by their
            scenario-level orders.
        major_lines (DictType(int64, Line_InstanceType)): Typed dictionary of major Line instances keyed by their
            scenario-level orders. Major Lines are those that form connections between Nodes in the transmission
            network.
        minor_lines (DictType(int64, Line_InstanceType)): Typed dictionary of minor Line instances keyed by their
            scenario-level orders. Minor Lines are those that form connections between Generator or Storage systems
            and the transmission network.
        routes (DictType(routes_key_type, routes_list_type)): Typed dictionary of Route lists keyed by (initial_node.order,
            legs). Each typed list value contains all Routes with the same initial node and the same length (legs).
        networksteps_max (int64): Maximum length of Routes used for transmission actions.
