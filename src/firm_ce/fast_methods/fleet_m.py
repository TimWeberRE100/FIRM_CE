    """
    A 'static' instance of the Fleet jitclass (Fleet.static_instance=True) is copied
    and marked as a 'dynamic' instance (Fleet.static_instance=False).

    Static instances are created during Model initialisation and supplied as arguments
    to the differential evolution. These arguments are references to the original jitclass instances (not copies).
    Candidate solutions within the differential evolution are tested in embarrasingly parrallel,
    making it unsafe for multiple workers to similtaneously modify the same memory referenced
    across each process.

    Instead, each worker must create a deep copy of the referenced instance that is safe to modify
    within that worker process. Not all attributes within a dynamic instance are safe to modify.
    Only attributes that are required to be modified when testing the candidate solution are
    copied in order to save memory. If an attribute is unsafe to modify after copying, it will
    be marked with a comment that says "This remains static" in the create_dynamic_copy fast_method for
    that jitclass.

    Parameters:
    -------
    fleet_instance (Fleet_InstanceType): A static instance of the Fleet jitclass.
    nodes_typed_dict (DictType(int64, Node_InstanceType)): A typed dictionary of
