    A 'static' instance of the Storage jitclass (Storage.static_instance=True) is copied
    and marked as a 'dynamic' instance (Storage.static_instance=False).

    Static instances are created during Model initialisation and supplied as arguments
    to the differential evolution. These arguments are references to the original jitclass instances (not copies).
    Candidate solutions within the differential evolution are tested in embarrasingly parrallel,
    making it unsafe for multiple workers to similtaneously modify the same memory referenced
    across each process.

    Instead, each worker must create a deep copy of the referenced instance that is safe to modify
    within that worker process. Not all attributes within a dynamic instance are safe to modify.
    Only attributes that are required to be modified when testing the candidate solution are
    copied in order to save memory. If an attribute is unsafe to modify after copying, it will
    be marked with a comment that says "This remains static" in the create_dynamic_copy fast_method for
    that jitclass.

    At the start of a time interval within the precharging period, the remaining trickling reserves,

    The trickling flag is True if the Storage system has sufficient stored energy

    Within the precharging period (leading up to the deficit block), the maximum dispatch power adjustment for a
    Storage system in a time interval is based upon the unused power capacity and remaining trickling reserves.

    dispatch power during that time interval. Nodal values for the cumulative maximum charge/discharge power
    adjustments across the Storage system merit order at a Node are also stored within an array.

    For a trickle-charger, the dispatch power adjustment includes a reduction in charging power and an increase
    in discharging power. For a precharger, the dispatch power adjustment includes a reduction in discharging
    power and increase in charging power.
